                        <p>
                            This two-part tutorial covers several core programming concepts that we'll build upon during an interactive lecture starting at 10.  There's a break in the middle, and exercises at the middle and end to help review the material.  If you finish early, there's more advanced things to work on; if you aren't done at 10, we'll have time to catch up later.  Please go at your own pace, and feel free to ask your instructors or classmates if you have any questions.
                        </p>

                            This is an interactive tutorial! As you go through this tutorial, any time you see something that looks like this:

                            you should type the expression at a Python prompt, hitting Return after every line and noting the output.

                            A <span class="stickynote">string</span> is just what Python calls a bunch of characters (like numbers, letters, whitespace, and punctuation) put together. Strings are indicated by being surrounded by quotes:

                            Try it now! Open your Python shell and type your own name in (don't forget the quotes):

                            There.  FYI, we've been using double quotes around our strings, but you can use either double or single quotes:

                            Use whichever quotes make the most sense for you, but be consistent.

                        <p>
                            What if we try this?

                        <p>
                            Hey now! The output from the previous example was really different and interesting; can you see where the problem was?  Let's break down exactly what happened:
                        </p>
                        <p>
<pre>
>>> 'Alice's restaurant'
File "<stdin>", line 1
'Alice's restaurant'
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is giving us some useful feedback, a <code>SyntaxError</code>.  When Python looks at that expression, it sees the string 'Alice' and then
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            s restaurant'
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            which it doesn't understand -- it's not 'valid' Python. Those letters don't mean anything to Python (outside of a string), and that trailing quote isn't balanced. So it raises a <code>SyntaxError</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can use double quotes to avoid this problem:
                        </p>
                    <div class="console">
                        <span></span>

                            This looks kind of like the last error we got, but instead of a <code>SyntaxError</code>, it's a <code>NameError</code>.  Python thinks <code>Alice</code> is the name of a <span class="stickynote">variable</span>, but it's confused because we haven't defined any variables named Alice yet.

                            A lot of work gets done in Python using variables.  You can stick all kinds of pieces of information inside of them, and store that information for later use.

                            Giving a name to your piece of information, so that you can refer to it by that name, is called <span class="stickynote">assignment</span>. Above, we assigned the name <code>name</code> to the information <code>"Alice"</code>, and after that we can use <code>name</code> wherever we want to use the string <code>"Alice"</code>.

                            Variables can't have spaces or other special characters, and they need to start with a letter. Here are some valid variable names:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>my_name</code><br />
                            <code>magic_word</code><br />
                            <code>numberOfCats</code><br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Projects develop naming conventions: maybe multi-word variable names use underscores (like <code>magic_word</code>), or "camel case" (like <code>numberOfCats</code>). The most important thing is to be consistent within a project, because it makes the code more readable.

                            are both valid Python and mean the same thing.  You should strive to be consistent with whatever spacing you like (or is required by a job or standard for an open source project), since it makes reading the code easier.

                            A <span class="stickynote">data type</span> is the kind of thing Python thinks something is.  So far we've seen two data types: <b>strings</b> and <b>integers</b> (the <code>'int'</code> in that last traceback).  Strings, as we've seen, are bunches of alphanumeric characters run together.  Integers are just like in math class -- numbers like 1, 2, 0, or -1 that don't contain fractions.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                If you have experience with other programming languages, you may find that Python is much more casual about type declarations than you're used to.  The TAs will be happy to chat about that if you're curious.
                            </div>
                            Python cares what type a thing is because it affects what you can do with that thing.  It makes sense to ask what the length of a string is, but it doesn't make sense to ask what the length of an integer is:
                        </p>

                            We haven't really defined the term <span class="stickynote">function</span> yet.  We'll talk about functions more in a bit, and write our own, but for now know these things:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Functions encapsulate some useful bit of work. We save that useful bit of work inside the function so we don't have to type it over and over again every time we want to use it. So, for example, some nice person decided that being able to determine the length of a string was useful, so he or she put the Python code that figures out an string's length into the function type, and now we all get to use it, instead of having to write it ourselves.</li>
                            <li>You provide input to a function and it produces output. The length function takes a string as an input, and returns an integer telling you how long the string is as output.</li>
                            <li>To use a function, write the name of the function followed by an open parenthesis, what the function takes as input (we call that input the <span class="stickynote">arguments</span> to the function), and then a close parenthesis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            One function you may find useful, now that you know about data types, is <code>type()</code>.  It takes an object as an argument, and returns that object's type.

                            By the way, this isn't true any more in Python 3.0 &mdash; division is smart enough to switch to floats automatically.  While Python 3.0 is available, most people are still using a 2.x version, so that's what we're doing.  If you find yourself working on a Python 3.x project, though, you'll want to read up on <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/index.html">the changes between versions</a>.

                            Hey now! That last result is probably not what you expected. What's going on here is that integer divison produces an integer. You need a number that knows about the decimal point to get a decimal out of division:

                            This means you have to be careful when manipulating fractions. If you were making some pie and needed to add 3/4 of a cup of flour and 1/4 of a cup of flour, you know in your heads that 3/4 + 1/4 = 1 cup. But try that at the Python prompt:

                            What do you need to do to get the right answer? Use data types that understand decimals for each of the divisions:
                        </p>

                            The two previous expressions produce the same result. You only need to make one of the numbers in each fraction have a decimal. When the Python interpreter goes to do the division, it notices that one of the numbers in the fraction cares about decimals and says "that means I have to make the other number care about decimals too".
