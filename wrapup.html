                            Please come to our <a href="http://ala13.ala.org/node/10902">interest group meeting</a> (Saturday at 1, Hilton-Marquette)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also <a href="http://connect.ala.org/node/167971">join our Connect group</a> to stay in the loop about (and create!) future opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We need a volunteer to write a TechConnect post!  (We'd love it if you blogged, tweeted, Instagrammed, tumblred, etc. your experience in your own social media spaces, too.  Tag it with #ala2013py.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're not yet on the class Google group (ala2013py), please ask a TA to be added so that you can get follow-up info and talk Python with your new friends!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, we need you to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/litapython">give us feedback</a> on how this preconference went.

                            Again, a big thank you to the <a href="http://python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> and Polly-Alida Farrington of <a href="http://www.pafa.net/">PA Farrington Associates</a> for feeding us lunch.

                            This curriculum was very lightly modified from that of the <a href="http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/">Boston Python Workshop</a>.  As part of the PSF's <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/DiversityInPython">commitment to diversity</a>, this organization has taught Python basics to hundreds of people, mostly women.

                        <p>
                            The stylesheet came from <a href="http://workshops.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a>, the program that inspired the Boston Python Workshop.  If you enjoyed today and would also like to learn some Ruby, look into Railsbridge.

                            Thank you to LITA and ALCTS for supporting the interest group, and the LITA staff in particular for their help in running this event.
                        </p>

                            And thanks to our great staff members, who ran around answering Python questions all day!
